 *
 * WHAT THE WORDS ARE ALLOWED TO CLAIM. PHASE 72 changed this paragraph, and the
 * change is the phase. A remote session now HAS a row in Tortie's own records
 * and it has saved output on this Mac, so Tortie can start it again on that
 * machine. Two things it still does not have, and every sentence here has to
 * keep saying so: there is no conversation id for it, so the conversation does
 * not come back, and the saved output is not put back into the recreated
 * session on the other machine. There is also no launch snapshot for it, which
 * is what {@link NO_SNAPSHOT} says.
 *
 * Machines have labels and sessions have names. No sentence here names the
 * transport, the program Tortie runs on the far side, or any of its verbs.
